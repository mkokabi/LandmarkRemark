# Landmark Remark

## Goal
allows users to save location based notes on a map.
These notes can be  displayed on the map where they were saved and 
viewed by the user that  created the note as well as other users 
of the application. 

## User stories

1. As a user (of the application) I can see my current location on a map  
2. As a user I can save a short note at my current location  
3. As a user I can see notes that I have saved at the location they were saved  on the map  
4. As a user I can see the location, text, and user-name of notes other users  have saved  
5. As a user I have the ability to search for a note based on contained text or  user-name
